# Images Directory

This directory should contain:

1. **author.jpg** - Author avatar image (referenced in MDX frontmatter)
   - Recommended size: 400x400px
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - You can use a placeholder from https://ui-avatars.com/ or your own photo

2. **default-cover.jpg** - Default cover image for posts without custom covers
   - Recommended size: 1200x600px
   - Format: JPG
   - You can use a placeholder from https://unsplash.com/

## Quick Setup with Placeholders

If you don't have images yet, you can:

1. **For author.jpg:**
   - Download from: https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=Your+Name&size=400&background=00F0FF&color=fff
   - Or use any square profile image

2. **For default-cover.jpg:**
   - Find free images at https://unsplash.com/
   - Search for tech, code, or abstract images
   - Download in 1200x600 resolution

## Note

The blog will work without these images if your MDX files use external URLs (like Unsplash) for cover images. These are only needed if:
- You want a local default cover image
- Your posts reference `/images/author.jpg`
